## **Deliverables Checklist ‚úÖ**

Please organize and complete the following deliverables within this repository:

### 1. **Codebase**
- Ensure all code is well-structured and documented.
- Use folders for modularity and clarity. Include any configuration or setup files.

### 2. **Demo Video**
- Upload your video to YouTube, Vimeo, or as an mp4 file.
- **Link to Demo Video**: [Demo Video](https://vimeo.com/1033586809?share=copy)

### 3. **Live Application URL**
- Deploy your application to a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
- **Link to Live App**: [hellotractor.app](https://hello-tractor-0e3507994143.herokuapp.com/)

### 4. **Technical Documentation**
- Include setup instructions for running the project locally.

#### Requirements
You'll need the following installed to run the project successfully:

Ruby 3.2+
Node.js v20+
PostgreSQL 15+
Redis - For ActionCable support (and Sidekiq, caching, etc)
Foreman - `gem install foreman` - helps run all your processes in development

#### Initial Setup
First, clone the app

```dotnetcli
git clone https://github.com/Hello-Tractor-Community/ht-marketplace-hackathon-annastacia-hello-tractor
cd ht-marketplace-hackathon-annastacia-hello-tractor
```
Run `bin/setup` to install Ruby and JavaScript dependencies and setup your database.

```dotnetcli
  bin/setup
```

#### Running The Project
To run your application, you'll use the bin/dev command:

```
bin/dev
```

This starts up Foreman (or Overmind) running the processes defined in `Procfile.dev`. We've configured this to run the Rails server, CSS bundling, and JS bundling out of the box. You can add background workers like Sidekiq, etc to have them run at the same time.






- Provide any architecture diagrams or flowcharts explaining the design.
- **Documentation**: Add details in a `docs/` folder or link to relevant markdown files.

### 5. **Project Report**
Complete this section in a separate ReadMe file `report.md`:
- **Project Name**: [Insert your project name]
- **Team Members**: [List all members and their GitHub handles]
- **Tech Stack**: [Mention all technologies used]
- **Key Features**: [Briefly list the implemented features]
