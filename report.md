- **Key Features**:
    1. Homepage
       - Built a simple landing page that has calls to actions for the user to discover different tractor listings.
       - Users can also filter for tractors by different specs eg price, location and make.
    2. Authorization and Authentication
       - Users can register on the website to either purchase or sell a tractor.
       - The sign up is easy, they just have to fill a few details and get a verification code to their phone numbers before they proceed.
    3. Selling Tractors
       - Sellers can list different specs of the tractor they are selling eg make, model, hours of usage, description, location and price.
       - Sellers can have draft listings that they can later submit for approval to be posted to the marketplace.
     4. Admin
         - Adminuser has a great user interface to see all sellers on the website and quick buttons to approve listings for postings.

- **Challenges**
    1. Time constraint
       - Limited time to build the system. Focused on the Key features that can be iterated on in the future.
    2. Limited Resources
       - No provisions for data, play resources eg paid account for Africas Talking to verify phone numbers, paid resources for hosting. Looked for free trials.

     1. Possible to build slowly while iterating to deliver simple solutions to complex systems.
     2. There are many opportunities for technology to build and grow the agriculture sector in Kenya.
